## Some programming terms:

- Spaghetti code: complicated, difficult to understand and maintain
- Variable: value with a type identified using a name
- Data structure: a way of organizing data in a computer program
- 

## Traditional and Agile software development

### What are software development methodologies?

There are different ways to develop a software system.
Sure, you can just sit down and start typing source code.
This works until, well, it doesn't. For anything more complicated than a "Hello world" app, you will need
a way to organize your work.
And if you're not working alone, the lack of a reasonably well defined process is going to lead to
chaos.

As the complexity of a project and the number of involved people increases, the need for a development
process becomes more and more prevalent.
Different approaches have been invented to solve this situation.
We're going to talk about two of the most popular development methodologies, namely: The Waterfall model,
which requires you to have a detailed plan before starting any coding.
The requirements need to be fixed, so no changes are expected during development.
And the second one is the change friendly, responsive, Agile approach, which works great for projects
where the expectations can change rapidly and frequently.

Now, before we dive into these methodologies, I must tell you one thing.
None of these systems can precisely describe every step of the software development process, but we
definitely need them to synchronize and organize our development related activities - activities that
include not only coding, but also design, product management, budgeting, testing, documentation,
release and maintenance.

### A brief history of programming

Programming paradigms:

- 1950: non-structured programming
  - sequentially ordered instructions
  - numbered code lines

```sinclair
10 PRINT "Fahrenheit", "Celsius"
20 PRINT
30 INPUT "Enter degree F", F
40 PRINT F, (F-32) * 5/9
50 GO TO 30
```

- 1960: structured programming
  - logical steps
  - relies on subroutines: contain a set of instructions to be carried out
  - improves code readability
  - reduces development time

- 1980: object oriented programming
  - split apart the program into self-contained objects
  - an object acts as a program
  - an object operates on its own data
  - each object interacts with other objects
